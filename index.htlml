<h5>A funny story</h5>
<p>Maybe not a really funny story but a good anekdote.</p>
<p>When i did interrail with my friends we met with a guy in Italy. When we were going to Capri we were talking each other and one guy heard us on a ferry. He asked us which language are we speaking and then we became friend with him. We encountered him in Rome and we just learned that he was a tour guide. So he explained all the details about historical places it was amazing.</p>

<h6> TL;DR </h6>

<p>When i did interrail with my friends we met a guy in Capri and he became our friend and guide.</p>
